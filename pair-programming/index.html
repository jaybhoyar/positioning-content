                <div class="row">
                    <div class="box box1">These two divs are positioned next to one another using <span
                            class="code">display:
                            inline-block;</span></div>
                    <div class="box box1">Notice the space between them. It occurs
                        because of my carriage return in the HTML
                        which I've used to keep the code organized.
                        I've used a reset to ensure no elements
                        should have any default margin or padding.
                        (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier
                        to read.) This space is actually a space
                        character rendered just as it would be
                        between two inline elements.</div>

                    <div class="box box2">You can see that, even though the elements
                        are spaced in the code, the space is not actually rendered on the
                        page.This may not be a huge deal in these first examples, but...</div>

                    <div class="box box3">What if I want my side-by-side elements to take up the full width of the
                        parent element? I can set the width of each to 50%, right? </div>
                    <div class="box box3">Wrong! Because, together, the two inline block elements will add up to 100% of
                        the available width, but that doesn't account for the space between. </div>
